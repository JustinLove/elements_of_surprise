# Elements of Surprise

Materials may not be what they seem. Is that real Ambrosia, or will you become a sheep? Is that pool of water safe, or is it Accelratium... or Lava?

## Compatable mods:

- Alternate Biomes (mod order depedent, have Elements lower)
- Chemical Curiosities
- Graham's Things
- More Creeps & Weirdos
- Noitavania

Other material mods will not be used. Other biome mods may be order dependent.

## In-game Options

- Randomized Materials: if on, material relationships are randomized based on what is available in potions. Otherwise a curated list of vnialla materials and what they look like is used. This must be on to use modded materials.
- Potion Mimic Chance: percent chance a potion appears as something else.
- Natural Material Chance: whether and how often naturally occuring pools can be a mimic material.
